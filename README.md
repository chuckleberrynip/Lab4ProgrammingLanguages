# Lab4ProgrammingLanguages
### My experience trying to learn 2 new programming language. <br>
#### Within this repository: 
  * Implementation of two sorting algorithms in JavaScript and Python. 
  * A planning report that contains the sources of learning, the pseudocode, <br> and the reference guide. 
  * A reflection report highlighting what it felt to learn the languages using the structured method.
#### Regarding the code:
  * The algorithms that were chosen were the bubble sort and the selection sort. <br> The main benefit with these sorts is that they are simple and use the same tools as other sorts, <br> meaning they are made up of the same parts like variables, loops, and conditional statements.
  *  The most interesting version, I think, was the Python implementation because it has a syntax that can be very <br> challenging for a person who is used to programming in a certain format (i.e. Java or C++).
